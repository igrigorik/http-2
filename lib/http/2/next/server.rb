module HTTP2Next
  # HTTP 2.0 server connection class that implements appropriate header
  # compression / decompression algorithms and stream management logic.
  #
  # Your code is responsible for feeding request data to the server object,
  # which in turn performs all of the necessary HTTP 2.0 decoding / encoding,
  # state management, and the rest. A simple example:
  #
  # @example
  #     socket = YourTransport.new
  #
  #     conn = HTTP2Next::Server.new
  #     conn.on(:stream) do |stream|
  #       ...
  #     end
  #
  #     while bytes = socket.read
  #       conn << bytes
  #     end
  #

    attr_reader :origin_set

    #
    # Requests that contain a payload body MUST be sent in their entirety
    # before the client can send HTTP/2 frames. This means that a large
    # request can block the use of the connection until it is completely sent.
    #
    # If concurrency of an initial request with subsequent requests is
    # important, an OPTIONS request can be used to perform the upgrade to
    # HTTP/2, at the cost of an additional round trip.

    # - The first HTTP/2 frame sent by the server MUST be a server
    #   connection preface (Section 3.5) consisting of a SETTINGS frame.
    # - Upon receiving the 101 response, the client MUST send a connection
    #   preface (Section 3.5), which includes a SETTINGS frame.
    #
    # The HTTP/1.1 request that is sent prior to upgrade is assigned a stream
    # identifier of 1 (see Section 5.1.1) with default priority values
    # (Section 5.3.5). Stream 1 is implicitly "half-closed" from the client
    # toward the server (see Section 5.1), since the request is completed as
    # an HTTP/1.1 request. After commencing the HTTP/2 connection, stream 1
    # is used for the response.
