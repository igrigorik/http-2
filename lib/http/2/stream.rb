module HTTP2

  # A single HTTP 2.0 connection can multiplex multiple streams in parallel:
  # multiple requests and responses can be in flight simultaneously and stream
  # data can be interleaved and prioritized.
  #
  # This class encapsulates all of the state, transition, flow-control, and
  # error management as defined by the HTTP 2.0 specification. All you have
  # to do is subscribe to appropriate events (marked with ":" prefix in
  # diagram below) and provide your application logic to handle request
  # and response processing.
